NOTE: This project was run using jupter notebook and anaconda distribution of python.

Steps to run:
1. Create your twitter account.
2. Get 4 secret keys from twitter (consumer key, consumer secret, access token, access token_secret). You can google how to do this. (Since these are secret keys so we cant share ours). Once you obtain those keys, paste them in "fetching only words from tweets string.py" file. 
3. Paste and run lines from "fetching only words from tweets string.py" in a jupyter notebook. This will generate a "fetchonlywords.csv" file similar to the one shared (containing tweets).

4. Now, similarly run the other 2 files (K-means Clustering.py and topic-modeling-gensim-python.py) in a jupyter ipynb notebook (these files use fetchonlywords.csv generated above).
